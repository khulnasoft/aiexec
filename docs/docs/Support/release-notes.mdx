This page summarizes significant changes to Aiexec in each release.
For all changes, see the [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/khulnasoft/aiexec/releases/latest).

Due to strict SemVer requirements, Aiexec Desktop can have different patch versions than the core Aiexec OSS Python package, but the major and minor versions are aligned.

## Prepare to upgrade

:::important
Whenever possible, the Aiexec team recommends installing new Aiexec versions in a new virtual environment or VM before upgrading your primary installation.
This allows you to [import flows](/concepts-flows-import#import-a-flow) from your existing installation and test them in the new version without disrupting your existing installation.
In the event of breaking changes or bugs, your existing installation is preserved in a stable state.
:::

To avoid the impact of potential breaking changes and test new versions, the Aiexec team recommends the following upgrade process:

1. Recommended: [Export your projects](/api-projects#export-a-project) to create backups of your flows:

    ```bash
    curl -X GET \
    "$AIEXEC_SERVER_URL/api/v1/projects/download/$PROJECT_ID" \
      -H "accept: application/json" \
      -H "x-api-key: $AIEXEC_API_KEY"
    ```

   To export flows from the visual editor, see [Import and export flows](/concepts-flows-import).

2. Install the new version:

   * **Aiexec OSS Python package**: Install the new version in a new virtual environment. For instructions, see [Install and run the Aiexec OSS Python package](/get-started-installation#install-and-run-the-aiexec-oss-python-package).
   * **Aiexec Docker image**: Run the new image in a separate container.
   * **Aiexec Desktop**: To upgrade in place, open Aiexec Desktop, and then click **Upgrade Available** in the Aiexec header. If you want to isolate the new version, you must install Aiexec Desktop on a separate physical or virtual machine, and then [import your flows](/concepts-flows-import) to the new installation.

3. [Import your flows](/concepts-flows-import) to test them in the new version, [upgrading components](/concepts-components#component-versions) as needed.

    When upgrading components, you can use the **Create backup flow before updating** option if you didn't previously export your flows.

4. If you installed the new version in isolation, upgrade your primary installation after testing the new version.

    If you made changes to your flows in the isolated installation, you might want to export and import those flows back to your upgraded primary installation so you don't have to repeat the component upgrade process.

## 1.5.0

Highlights of this release include the following changes.
For all changes, see the [Changelog](https://gitlab.com/khulnasoft/aiexec/releases).

### New features and enhancements

- Authentication changes

    To enhance security and ensure proper authentication for automatic login features, most API endpoints now require authentication with a Aiexec API key, regardless of the `AUTO_LOGIN` setting.
    The only exceptions are the MCP endpoints `/v1/mcp`, `/v1/mcp-projects`, and `/v2/mcp`, which never require authentication.
    For more information, see [API keys and authentication](/api-keys-and-authentication).

- Centralized **Language Model** and **Embedding Model** components

    The [**Language Model** component](/components-models) and [**Embedding Model** component](/components-embedding-models) are now core components for your LLM and embeddings flows. They support multiple models and model providers, and allow you to experiment with different models without swapping out single-provider components.
    Find them in the visual editor in the **Models** category.

    The single-provider components moved to the [**Bundles**](/components-bundle-components) section.
    You can use them to replace the **Language Model** and **Embedding Model** core components, or connect them to the **Agent** component with the **Custom** provider option.

- MCP server one-click installation

    On your Aiexec project's **MCP server** page, click **Auto install** to install your Aiexec MCP server to MCP clients with just one click.
    The option to install with a JSON configuration file is available for macOS, Windows, and WSL.
    For more information, see [Use Aiexec as an MCP server](/mcp-server).

- MCP server management

    You can now add, remove, and edit your MCP servers in the **MCP Tools** components and through your Aiexec **Settings** page.
    For more information, see [Use Aiexec as an MCP client](/mcp-client).

- Input schema replaces temporary overrides

    The **Input schema** pane replaces the need to manage tweak values in the **API access** pane. When you enable a parameter in the **Input schema** pane, the parameter is automatically added to your flow's code snippets, providing ready-to-use templates for making requests in your preferred programming language.

- **Tools** components are redistributed

    All components in the **Tools** category were moved to other component categories, such as **Helpers** and [bundles](/components-bundle-components), or marked as legacy.

    The [**MCP Tools** component](/mcp-client) is now under the **Agents** category.

    Tools that performed the same function were combined into single components that support multiple providers, such as the [**Web Search** component](/components-data#web-search) and the [**News Search** component](/components-data#news-search).

    For more information, see [**Tools** components](/components-tools).

- Stability improvements

    General stability improvements and bug fixes for enhanced reliability.

   - [**Cleanlab** bundle](/integrations-cleanlab)
